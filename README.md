📅 Event Scheduling using Hash Table with Collision Handling in C

An efficient scheduling system built using C programming that utilizes a hash table to allocate events to time slots. The system handles scheduling conflicts using linear probing, ensuring no two events overwrite each other.


🛠 Tools & Technologies
Language: C

Data Structure: Hash Table

Collision Resolution Technique: Linear Probing

💡 Code Explanation

Component	Description
struct hash	Defines each time slot with an integer n representing a scheduled event.
time[m] =>	Hash table array with m = 10 total slots.
create_time( )=>	Initializes all time slots to 0 (empty).
insert() =>	Takes an event as input, calculates a hash, and attempts to place it in a slot.
collision()	=> If the hashed slot is occupied, finds the next empty slot using linear probing.
display() =>	Displays all scheduled events with their respective slots.
main() =>	Provides a user menu to insert events, view schedule, or exit.

🌟 Features (Current Phase)
Event insertion with auto-assigned time slot using hash function

Collision handling using Linear Probing

Hash Table-based efficient event lookup

Simple and clean Command Line Interface (CLI)

Reusable modular functions (insert, collision, display, etc.)

Real-time feedback for collision and successful scheduling

Predefined fixed-size hash table for simplicity and clarity
